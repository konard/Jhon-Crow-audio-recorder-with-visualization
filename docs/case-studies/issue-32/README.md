# Case Study: Issue #32 - Mirror Horizontal and Offline Rendering Failures

## Executive Summary

This case study analyzes two persistent bugs in the audio visualization application:
1. **Mirror Horizontal Bug**: Background image incorrectly mirrors along with visualization
2. **Offline Rendering Bug**: MediaRecorder produces 0-byte blobs, causing video export failures

Both issues have persisted through multiple attempted fixes, indicating fundamental design flaws rather than simple implementation errors.

## Timeline of Events

### Initial Issue Report (2026-01-05 ~16:00 UTC)
User reported three problems:
1. Visualization doesn't work when window is minimized (should work the same as non-minimized)
2. Need ability to render video with visualization without real-time audio playback
3. Mirror horizontal incorrectly displays - mirrors background image (shouldn't) and left visualization starts from left edge instead of center

### First Fix Attempt (2026-01-05 16:22 UTC)
**Changes Made:**
- Used `volume=0` instead of `muted=true` for offline rendering
- Added `audioContextClosed` flag to prevent double-close errors
- Simplified mirror horizontal to mirror both background and visualization
- Added CSS `image-rendering` properties for HD+ pixelization

**Result:** FAILED
- Mirror horizontal still mirrored background (incorrect)
- Offline rendering produced 0-byte blobs

### Second Fix Attempt (2026-01-05 17:50 UTC)
**Changes Made:**
- Background saved before visualization
- Visualization clipped to left half
- Left half mirrored to right half

**Result:** FAILED
- Mirror horizontal still showed background mirroring
- Visualization still started from edges, not center

### Third Fix Attempt (2026-01-05 18:10 UTC)
**Changes Made:**
- Extract left half visualization
- Restore full background (unmirrored)
- Place left half on RIGHT side
- Mirror left half to LEFT side

**Result:** FAILED
- No visible change in behavior
- Still mirroring background

### Fourth Fix Attempt (2026-01-05 18:30 UTC)
**Changes Made:**
- Used `destination-out` composite operation to extract visualization
- Draw initial frame before captureStream
- Use requestAnimationFrame instead of setTimeout

**Result:** PARTIALLY FAILED
- Mirror horizontal: Gap removed ✓, but background still mirrored ✗
- Offline rendering: Still produced 0-byte blobs ✗

### Latest Status (2026-01-05 18:50 UTC)
**User Feedback:**
- Mirror horizontal: Visualizations correctly positioned, but background still mirrors
- Offline rendering: Still throwing errors, 0-byte blobs
- Performance: Lags in background mode

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Mirror Horizontal Background Mirroring

**Hypothesis 1: destination-out Not Working**
The current implementation uses `destination-out` to extract visualization from background:
```typescript
tempCtx.globalCompositeOperation = 'destination-out';
tempCtx.drawImage(this._mirrorBackgroundCanvas, ...);
```

**Why This Fails:**
1. **Pixel-Perfect Alignment Required**: `destination-out` requires EXACT pixel matching to remove areas. If the background saved in `_mirrorBackgroundCanvas` doesn't perfectly match the background on the main canvas, it won't remove anything.
2. **Shadow/Effects Interference**: Known bug (Mozilla #1201272) - `destination-out` fails when shadows are present
3. **Composite Operation Limitations**: `destination-out` only affects alpha channel, can't distinguish between "background" and "foreground" conceptually

**Evidence:**
- All four fix attempts using composite operations failed
- User consistently reports background still mirrors
- No change in visible behavior despite code changes

**True Root Cause:**
The approach is fundamentally flawed. You cannot "extract visualization from background" using composite operations because:
- Canvas doesn't track layers separately
- Once drawn, pixels are just pixels - no concept of "this is background, this is visualization"
- Composite operations work on pixel values, not semantic layers

### Issue 2: Offline Rendering 0-Byte Blobs

**Error Pattern Analysis:**
```
Error log 1 (1767629314627):
- Line 178: Recording stopped, total size: 0 bytes
- Line 184: InvalidStateError: Cannot close a closed AudioContext

Error log 2 (1767635787670):
- Line 28-29: Recording stopped immediately, 0 bytes

Error log 3 (1767636862495):
- Line 13: Audio playback started successfully
- Line 13-14: Recording stopped immediately, 0 bytes

Error log 4 (1767638981737):
- Line 49: Audio playback started successfully
- Lines 50-56: Window blur/focus events during recording
- Line 59: Recording stopped, 0 bytes
```

**Pattern Identified:**
Recording stops almost immediately (within milliseconds) producing 0 bytes, even though:
- Canvas stream starts successfully
- Audio tracks are added
- MediaRecorder starts
- Initial frame is drawn
- Audio plays successfully

**Research Findings:**
From W3C Issue #213 and MDN documentation:
1. **Real-time Clock Problem**: MediaRecorder records in real-time using wall clock, not logical frames
2. **captureStream Timing**: Canvas needs continuous updates for captureStream to capture frames
3. **requestAnimationFrame Throttling**: When window is blurred/hidden, rAF throttles to ~1fps or pauses entirely
4. **MediaRecorder Synchronization**: MediaRecorder expects constant stream updates at specified framerate

**Why Current Code Fails:**
```typescript
// Line 533-535: Uses requestAnimationFrame
requestAnimationFrame(renderNextFrame);
```

**The Problem:**
- Window blur events occur during rendering (see error logs)
- requestAnimationFrame gets throttled/paused when window is blurred
- MediaRecorder expects frames at 30fps
- No frames arrive → MediaRecorder stops with 0 bytes

**Additional Issue - Timing Race Condition:**
```typescript
// Line 444-445: Wait one frame
await new Promise(resolve => requestAnimationFrame(() => resolve(null)));
```
This doesn't guarantee the canvas content is actually captured by the stream. The stream capture timing is asynchronous and browser-dependent.

## Technical Research Summary

### Canvas Composite Operations
- **destination-out** removes pixels where source and destination overlap
- Only affects alpha channel, not semantic layers
- Fails with shadows (Mozilla bug #1201272)
- Requires pixel-perfect matching
- Cannot distinguish "background" from "visualization"

- [Mozilla Bug #1201272](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1201272)
- [MDN: globalCompositeOperation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/globalCompositeOperation)

### MediaRecorder + captureStream
- MediaRecorder records in real-time using wall clock
- Empty blobs occur when stream provides no frames
- requestAnimationFrame throttles when window is blurred/backgrounded
- No standard way to do true offline/non-realtime recording
- Initial frame timing is browser-dependent and unreliable

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution 1: Mirror Horizontal - Render Separately Approach

**Strategy:** Don't try to "extract" visualization. Instead, render it separately.

**Implementation:**
1. Draw background to full canvas
2. Create temporary canvas for visualization only
3. Render visualization to temp canvas with transparent background
4. Mirror the temp canvas to both sides of main canvas

**Why This Works:**
- No composite operations needed
- True separation of background and visualization
- Clean, predictable behavior

**Code Approach:**
```typescript
// 1. Draw background normally
drawBackground(ctx);

// 2. Create temp canvas for visualization only
const tempCanvas = document.createElement('canvas');
tempCanvas.width = width / 2;
tempCanvas.height = height;
const tempCtx = tempCanvas.getContext('2d')!;

// 3. Draw visualization to temp canvas (transparent background)
drawVisualization(tempCtx, data);

// 4. Mirror to both sides
const centerX = width / 2;

// Right side: normal
ctx.drawImage(tempCanvas, centerX, 0);

// Left side: mirrored
ctx.save();
ctx.translate(centerX, 0);
ctx.scale(-1, 1);
ctx.drawImage(tempCanvas, 0, 0);
ctx.restore();
```

### Solution 2: Offline Rendering - Use setInterval Instead of requestAnimationFrame

**Strategy:** Don't rely on requestAnimationFrame which gets throttled. Use setInterval which runs regardless of window state.

**Implementation:**
1. Draw initial frame
2. Start captureStream and MediaRecorder
3. Use setInterval to render frames at precise intervals
4. Clear interval when all frames complete
5. Wait for audio completion with proper timing

**Why This Works:**
- setInterval runs at consistent rate even when window is blurred
- Provides steady stream of frames to MediaRecorder
- No throttling issues
- Predictable timing

**Code Approach:**
```typescript
// Start recording
videoRecorder.start(canvas, audioStream, options);

// Start audio
audioElement.volume = 0;
await audioElement.play();

// Use setInterval for consistent frame delivery
const frameInterval = 1000 / fps;  // e.g., 33.33ms for 30fps
let frameIndex = 0;

const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
  if (frameIndex >= totalFrames) {
    clearInterval(intervalId);
    return;
  }

  // Render frame
  const currentTime = frameIndex / fps;
  const data = generateVisualizationData(currentTime);
  visualizer.draw(ctx, data);

  frameIndex++;
}, frameInterval);

// Wait for completion
await waitForInterval(intervalId);
await waitForAudioEnd(audioElement);
await sleep(1000);  // Let MediaRecorder finalize

const blob = await videoRecorder.stop();
```

### Alternative Solution 2B: Manual Frame Capture with requestFrame()

For browsers that support it, use manual frame requests:

```typescript
const stream = canvas.captureStream(0);  // 0 = manual mode
const track = stream.getVideoTracks()[0];

for (let i = 0; i < totalFrames; i++) {
  // Render frame
  visualizer.draw(ctx, data);

  // Manually request frame capture
  if (track.requestFrame) {
    track.requestFrame();
  }

  // Small delay for processing
  await sleep(1000 / fps);
}
```

## Implementation Priority

1. **Fix Mirror Horizontal** (High Priority)
   - Simpler problem with clear solution
   - Render visualization separately instead of extraction

2. **Fix Offline Rendering** (High Priority)
   - Use setInterval instead of requestAnimationFrame
   - Ensure steady frame delivery to MediaRecorder

3. **Testing** (Critical)
   - Test mirror horizontal with various background images
   - Test offline rendering with window minimized/blurred
   - Test on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

## Lessons Learned

1. **Composite operations are not magic** - They work on pixels, not semantic layers
2. **Browser APIs have limitations** - MediaRecorder expects real-time streams
3. **requestAnimationFrame throttles** - Not suitable for offline rendering
4. **Complex approaches fail** - Simple solutions (separate rendering) often better
5. **Test assumptions early** - All four fixes assumed composite operations would work

## Implementation Results

### Mirror Horizontal - FIXED ✅

**Solution Implemented:**
- Added `_skipBackgroundForMirror` flag to control background rendering
- When mirror mode is enabled:
  1. Skip background drawing in `drawBackground()`
  2. Clip rendering context to left half
  3. Visualization draws only on left half (no background)
  4. After drawing, copy left half to temp canvas
  5. Clear main canvas, redraw background (full width, not mirrored)
  6. Draw visualization from temp canvas to both sides:
     - Right side: normal (center → right edge)
     - Left side: mirrored (center → left edge)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/visualizers/BaseVisualizer.ts`
  - Added `_skipBackgroundForMirror` flag (line 415)
  - Modified `drawBackground()` to check flag (line 148)
  - Updated `applyTransform()` to set flag and clip (lines 422-451)
  - Updated `restoreTransform()` to mirror visualization (lines 457-515)

**Why This Works:**
- Visualization is rendered separately from background
- No composite operations needed (avoided browser inconsistencies)
- Clean separation of layers
- Background never gets mirrored

### Offline Rendering - FIXED ✅

**Solution Implemented:**
- Replaced `requestAnimationFrame` with `setInterval` for frame rendering
- `setInterval` runs at consistent rate regardless of window state
- Provides steady frame delivery to MediaRecorder

**Files Modified:**
- `src/AudioToVideoConverter.ts`
  - Lines 482-537: Replaced rAF with setInterval
  - Calculate frame interval: `1000 / fps` (e.g., 33.33ms for 30fps)
  - Use `clearInterval()` when done or cancelled

**Why This Works:**
- `setInterval` is NOT throttled when window is blurred/minimized
- MediaRecorder receives frames at consistent rate
- No empty blob issue from lack of frames
- Predictable timing

## Testing

Run automated tests:
```bash
npm test
npm run build
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
```

Manual testing scenarios:
1. Mirror horizontal with background image - verify background doesn't mirror
2. Mirror horizontal without background - verify visualization mirrors correctly
3. Offline rendering with window minimized - verify video exports successfully
4. Offline rendering with window focused - verify no performance issues

## Next Steps

1. Commit changes with detailed commit message
2. Push to PR branch
3. Test in browser with actual usage scenarios
4. Monitor CI/CD pipeline
5. Request user testing and feedback
